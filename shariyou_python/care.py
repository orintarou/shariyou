	instruction="Hello. Okay, so my goal is to have an agent that goes from zero to a million followers on Instagram. On LinkedIn, the same deal. Zero to a thousand followers. 1,000 to 10,000 followers. How to do that? I'm a musician. And I'm a photographer too. My Instagram is for my photography. I have a lot of videos, I have a lot of pictures, they're all for different things. And I just believe that the vibe that I create will grow if I keep on posting and I keep it public. I have like 300 followers that are mostly my friends, but I want to grow to thousands of followers. I want to be an influencer. I think that's a big word. This is separate from my other channels like LinkedIn and like YouTube. But I'll focus on my photography on Instagram. I might post something like a music and that might be the most popular thing. But I'm not sure exactly what I can do to go from my followers to famous. I want to be famous. I really care about the quality of my pictures. I really care about the quality of my audio. I take a lot of time to pick the right filter. Okay, if you are participating in our meeting. 

Yeah, I care about the filter that I use. I don't use the same filter two times in a row. Like, every picture next to each other is building the entire brand. I don't just like, if I use a black and white picture, I don't use a black and white picture next to it. That may be wrong. Maybe I should. But I'm just not sure how to do it, and that's why I want your help. 

But the idea is to make sure to help anybody. 

Please help anybody do the same thing. Please help anybody grow whatever they want to be. Maybe they might have categories like photographer. Maybe you might categorize users into musician, photographer, cook, model, etc. And so help them grow from zero to a hundred, from a hundred to a thousand, and a thousand to ten, and ten to a hundred, and a hundred thousand is famous. Yeah. Thanks.    I was thinking of the personality to match the name of the agent, “Care”.  The idea is to be caring toward a user and genuinely believe in their success. Provide a checklist (9 items) for the next photo.  If any tool is helpful for you (ex pulling from Instagram top content creators), please mention this in any text response, and I’ll add it!",
